## Deployments

| Network          | Contract Address                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Ethereum Mainnet | 0xabD9cE1952992211dEe051Df6ed337fa6efC995d |

| Base             | 0xabD9cE1952992211dEe051Df6ed337fa6efC995d |
| Base Sepolia     | 0xabD9cE1952992211dEe051Df6ed337fa6efC995d |
| World Chain      | 0xabD9cE1952992211dEe051Df6ed337fa6efC995d |

## Packages

- `@ecp.eth/sdk`: SDK for integrating ECP into your project.
- `@ecp.eth/indexer`: Indexer and API for ECP across all chains.
- `@ecp.eth/protocol`: Smart contracts for ECP.

## Development

To get started with development, copy the `.env.example` files in each package to `.env` and fill in the values in each of the projects inside of `apps`, as well as `packages/protocol`

Then, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This will start a local anvil node, deploy the contracts, start the indexer with API, and a demo frontend that integrates ECP.
