# `CommentManager`

This contract allows users to post and manage comments with optional app-signer approval and channel-specific hooks

Implements EIP-712 for typed structured data hashing and signing

## Functions

### `constructor(address initialOwner)` (public)

Constructor initializes the contract with the deployer as owner and channel manager

Sets up EIP-712 domain separator

### `postCommentAsAuthor(struct Comments.CommentData commentData, bytes appSignature)` (external)

Posts a comment directly from the author's address

### `postComment(struct Comments.CommentData commentData, bytes authorSignature, bytes appSignature)` (external)

Posts a comment with both author and app signer signatures

### `_postComment(struct Comments.CommentData commentData, bytes authorSignature, bytes appSignature)` (internal)

Internal function to handle comment posting logic

### `deleteCommentAsAuthor(bytes32 commentId)` (external)

Deletes a comment when called by the author directly

### `deleteComment(bytes32 commentId, address author, address app, uint256 nonce, uint256 deadline, bytes authorSignature, bytes appSignature)` (external)

Deletes a comment with author signature verification

### `_deleteComment(bytes32 commentId, address author)` (internal)

Internal function to handle comment deletion logic

### `_addApproval(address author, address app)` (internal)

Internal function to add an app signer approval

### `_revokeApproval(address author, address app)` (internal)

Internal function to remove an app signer approval

### `addApprovalAsAuthor(address app)` (external)

Approves an app signer when called directly by the author

### `revokeApprovalAsAuthor(address app)` (external)

Removes an app signer approval when called directly by the author

### `addApproval(address author, address app, uint256 nonce, uint256 deadline, bytes signature)` (external)

Approves an app signer with signature verification

### `removeApproval(address author, address app, uint256 nonce, uint256 deadline, bytes signature)` (external)

Removes an app signer approval with signature verification

### `getAddApprovalHash(address author, address app, uint256 nonce, uint256 deadline) → bytes32` (public)

Calculates the EIP-712 hash for a permit

### `getRemoveApprovalHash(address author, address app, uint256 nonce, uint256 deadline) → bytes32` (public)

Calculates the EIP-712 hash for removing an approval

### `getDeleteCommentHash(bytes32 commentId, address author, address app, uint256 nonce, uint256 deadline) → bytes32` (public)

Calculates the EIP-712 hash for deleting a comment

### `getCommentId(struct Comments.CommentData commentData) → bytes32` (public)

Calculates the EIP-712 hash for a comment

### `getComment(bytes32 commentId) → struct Comments.CommentData` (external)

Get comment data by ID

### `updateChannelContract(address _channelContract)` (external)

Updates the channel manager contract address (only owner)

### `_validateSignature(bytes signature)` (internal)

Validates a signature against malleability

Ensures signature follows EIP-2098 and has valid s value
