# `ICommentManager`

This interface defines the functions and events for the Comments contract







## Events

### `CommentAdded(bytes32 commentId, address author, address app, uint256 channelId, bytes32 parentId, uint96 createdAt, string content, string metadata, string targetUri, string commentType, string hookData)`

Emitted when a new comment is added




### `CommentDeleted(bytes32 commentId, address author)`

Emitted when a comment is deleted




### `CommentEdited(bytes32 commentId, address editedByApp, address author, address app, uint256 channelId, bytes32 parentId, uint96 createdAt, uint96 updatedAt, string content, string metadata, string targetUri, string commentType, string hookData)`

Emitted when a comment is edited




### `CommentHookDataUpdated(bytes32 commentId, string hookData)`

Emitted when a comment's hook data is updated




### `ApprovalAdded(address author, address app)`

Emitted when an author approves an app signer




### `ApprovalRemoved(address author, address app)`

Emitted when an author removes an app signer's approval

Deletes a comment when called by the author directly




### `deleteCommentWithSig(bytes32 commentId, address app, uint256 deadline, bytes authorSignature, bytes appSignature)` (external)

Deletes a comment with author signature verification




### `editComment(bytes32 commentId, struct Comments.EditComment editData, bytes appSignature)` (external)

Edits a comment when called by the author directly




### `editCommentWithSig(bytes32 commentId, struct Comments.EditComment editData, bytes authorSignature, bytes appSignature)` (external)
