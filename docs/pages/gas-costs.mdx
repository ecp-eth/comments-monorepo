# Gas Costs

This page provides an overview of typical gas costs for posting comments on different chains using the Ethereum Comments Protocol (ECP).

_Please note that the figures on this page are provided as estimates to give a general idea of transaction costs. The actual figures will vary._

## Base Network

Base is an Ethereum L2 that offers significantly lower gas costs compared to Ethereum mainnet. Here are estimated fees based on various L2 gas price:

  operations={[
    {
      name: "postCommentAsAuthor",
      gasUnits: 74000,
    },
    {
      name: "postComment",
      gasUnits: 60000,
    },
    {
      name: "Delete Comment",
      gasUnits: 25000,
    },

## Ethereum Mainnet

<GasEstimationTable
  operations={[
    {
      name: "postCommentAsAuthor",
      gasUnits: 74000,
    },
    {
      name: "postComment",
      gasUnits: 60000,
    },
    {
      name: "Delete Comment",
      gasUnits: 25000,
    },

# Example transactions:

For example a [`postCommentAsAuthor`](/protocol-reference/CommentManager#postcommentasauthorstruct-commentscommentdata-commentdata-bytes-appsignature-external) that replies to a comment,
the [transaction](https://basescan.org/tx/0x189c08c3b6bda7f098a649574e27d203aa1e760848197f447e9adfdbc8a3a465) is initiated and paid by the author,
it costs around `73,657` gas units, with a limit of `74,532` gas units on Base L2; `4,324` gas units on L1:

- With a gas price of `0.002915116 Gwei` on L2, the transaction fee on Base L2 is `0.000000218753205117 ETH`.
- With a gas price of `0.411140238 Gwei` on L1, after adjustment the final L1 fee is `0.000000004034505905 ETH`.

The user total paid for `0.000000218753205117 ETH` for the transaction, and at the time of transaction, it was `0.000439 USD`.

## Notes

- Gas costs are estimates and may vary based on:

  - The length of the comment content
  - Network congestion
  - Current gas prices
  - Additional metadata included

- Gas prices are highly variable. Check current gas prices on:

  - [Base Gas Tracker](https://basescan.org/gastracker)
  - [Ethereum Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)

- Dollar amounts are approximate and will vary based on:
  - Current ETH price
  - Gas price at time of transaction
  - Network conditions
