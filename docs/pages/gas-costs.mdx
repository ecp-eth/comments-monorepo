# Gas Costs

This page provides an overview of typical gas costs for posting comments on different chains using the Ethereum Comments Protocol (ECP).

_Please note that the figures on this page are provided as estimates to give a general idea of transaction costs. The actual figures will vary._

## Base Network

Base is an Ethereum L2 that offers significantly lower gas costs compared to Ethereum mainnet. Here are estimated fees based on varies L1 gas price:

| Operation           | Gas Units | at 0.1 gwei | at 0.5 gwei  | at 1 gwei      |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------- |

## Ethereum Mainnet

| Operation           | Gas Units | at 0.1 gwei | at 0.5 gwei  | at 1 gwei  |

# Example transactions:

For example a [`postCommentAsAuthor`](/protocol-reference/CommentsV1#postcommentasauthorstruct-commentsv1commentdata-commentdata-bytes-appsignature-external) that replies to a comment,
the [transaction](https://basescan.org/tx/0x6cb976aeb028cf51140dbfda25a77d628300f39e7244f860cdfc0e0da377c864) is initiated and paid by the author,
it costs around `66,843` gas units, with a limit of `67,691` gas units on Base L2; `4,190` gas units on L1:

- With a gas price of `0.003135673 Gwei` on L2, the transaction fee on Base L2 is  `0.000000209597790339 ETH`.
- With a gas price of `0.7471636 Gwei` on L1, after adjustment the final L1 fee is `0.000002326060890698 ETH`.

The user totally paid for `0.000002535658681037 ETH` for the transaction, and at the time of transaction, it was `0.006771 USD`.

## Notes

- Gas costs are estimates and may vary based on:

  - The length of the comment content
  - Network congestion
  - Current gas prices
  - Additional metadata included

- Gas prices are highly variable. Check current gas prices on:

  - [Base Gas Tracker](https://basescan.org/gastracker)
  - [Ethereum Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)

- Dollar amounts are approximate and will vary based on:
  - Current ETH price
  - Gas price at time of transaction
  - Network conditions
