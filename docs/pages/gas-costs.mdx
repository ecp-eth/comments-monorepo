# Gas Costs

This page provides an overview of typical gas costs for posting comments on different chains using the Ethereum Comments Protocol (ECP).

## Base Network

Base is an Ethereum L2 that offers significantly lower gas costs compared to Ethereum mainnet. Here are typical gas costs for posting a comment:
