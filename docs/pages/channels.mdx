# Channels

Each Comment in ECP is associated with a **Channel**. If not specified, the comment is associated with the default channel with id 0.
Channels are [ERC721 NFTs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) that can be owned, transferred, or traded.
The Channel owner can set the **Hooks** for their channel that enable flexible and powerful behaviors for comments in the channel, such as:

- Gating who can comment - by onchain primitives like NFTs or tokens
- Charging a small fee to post a comment
- Integrating with other protocols, such as tokens or NFTs

To prevent spam and ensure quality channels, creating a new channel requires paying a small fee. The current channel creation fee can be retrieved by calling `getChannelCreationFee` from the SDK. This fee helps maintain the quality of channels in the protocol while still keeping channel creation accessible.

Together with [Hooks](/hooks), Channels create a flexible system for building on-chain communities and apps with customizable rules.

## Getting Started

You can create channels and hooks using our [TypeScript SDK](/sdk-reference) or by interacting with our [smart contracts](/contracts).

For full code examples used in this guide, check out the [examples](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/examples/channels-and-hooks).

## TypeScript Examples

### Creating a Channel

Import the necessary functions from the `@ecp.eth/sdk` package:

```typescript
import {
  createChannel,
  getChannelCreationFee,
} from "@ecp.eth/sdk/channel-manager";
...
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
```

Initialize the account using `viem`. Ensure the account has enough balance to cover the channel creation fee:

```typescript
const account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);
```

Creating a channel requires paying a fee. The code below retrieves the channel creation fee and
calls the `createChannel` function from the SDK to create a new channel:

```typescript
const { fee } = await getChannelCreationFee({
  readContract: publicClient.readContract,
});
const { wait } = await createChannel({
  name: "Ethereum Comments Protocol Updates",
  description:
    "Latest updates and announcements from the Ethereum Comments Protocol",
  metadata: JSON.stringify({
    category: "blog",
    rules: ["Be respectful", "No spam"],
  }),
  hook: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // No hook initially
  fee: fee,
  writeContract: walletClient.writeContract,
});
```

#### Retrieve the Channel ID from Event Logs

Due to EVM limitations, return values from state-changing (write) contract calls are not propagated to off-chain callers.

To make things easier, the SDK provides a helper function to wait for the transaction to be mined and return the channel data from the event logs:

```typescript
const { wait } = await createChannel({...});

const createChannelEvent = await wait({
  getContractEvents: publicClient.getContractEvents,
  waitForTransactionReceipt: publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt,
});

if (!createChannelEvent) {
  throw new Error("Channel creation event not found");
}

console.log("Channel created, id:", createChannelEvent.channelId);
```

- See the full example [here](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/examples/channels-and-hooks/typescript/create-channel.ts).

## Solidity Examples

### Creating a Channel

First, retrieve the current channel creation fee:

```solidity
uint256 fee = channelManager.getChannelCreationFee();
```

Then create the channel and pass the fee:

```solidity
uint256 channelId = channelManager.createChannel{value: fee}(
    "My Channel",
    "Description",
    "{}",
    address(0)
);
```
