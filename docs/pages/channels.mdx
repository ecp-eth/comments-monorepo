# Channels

Each comment in ECP is associated with a **Channel**. If not specified, the comment is associated with the default channel with id 0.
Channels are [ERC721 NFTs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) that can be owned, transferred, or traded.
The channel owner can set the **hooks** for their channel that enable flexible and powerful behaviors for comments in the channel, such as:

- Gating who can comment - by onchain primitives like NFTs or tokens
- Charging a small fee to post a comment
- Integrating with other protocols, such as tokens or NFTs

To prevent spam and ensure quality channels, creating a new channel requires paying a small fee. The current channel creation fee can be retrieved by calling `getChannelCreationFee` from the SDK. This fee helps maintain the quality of channels in the protocol while still keeping channel creation accessible.

Together with [hooks](/hooks), channels create a flexible system for building onchain communities and apps with customizable rules.

Creating a channel currently requires paying a fee, currently set to 0.02 ETH, to deter initial spam, while we figure out how to combat it. If you are building an app that will create channels, feel free to reach out to us and we may be able to sponsor the channel fee.

## Getting Started

You can create channels and hooks using our [TypeScript SDK](/sdk-reference) or by interacting with our [smart contracts](/contracts).

For full code examples used in this guide, check out the [examples](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/examples/snippets).

## TypeScript Examples

### Creating a channel

Import the necessary functions from the `@ecp.eth/sdk` package:

```typescript
import {
  createChannel,
  getChannelCreationFee,
} from "@ecp.eth/sdk/channel-manager";
...
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
```

Initialize the account using `viem`. Ensure the account has enough balance to cover the channel creation fee:

```typescript
const account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);
```

The code below retrieves the channel creation fee and
calls the `createChannel` function from the SDK to create a new channel:

```typescript
const { fee } = await getChannelCreationFee({
  readContract: publicClient.readContract,
});
const { wait } = await createChannel({
  name: "Ethereum Comments Protocol Updates",
  description:
    "Latest updates and announcements from the Ethereum Comments Protocol",
  metadata: JSON.stringify({
    category: "blog",
    rules: ["Be respectful", "No spam"],
  }),
  hook: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // No hook initially
  fee: fee,
  writeContract: walletClient.writeContract,
});
```

#### Retrieve the channel ID from Event Logs

Due to EVM limitations, return values from state-changing (write) contract calls are not propagated to off-chain callers.

To make things easier, the SDK provides a helper function to wait for the transaction to be mined and return the channel data from the event logs:

```typescript
const { wait } = await createChannel({...});

const createChannelEvent = await wait({
  getContractEvents: publicClient.getContractEvents,
  waitForTransactionReceipt: publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt,
});

if (!createChannelEvent) {
  throw new Error("Channel creation event not found");
}

console.log("Channel created, id:", createChannelEvent.channelId);
```

- See the full example [here](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/examples/snippets/typescript/create-channel.ts).

## Solidity examples

### Creating a channel

First, retrieve the current channel creation fee:

```solidity
uint256 fee = channelManager.getChannelCreationFee();
```

Then create the channel and pass the fee:

```solidity
uint256 channelId = channelManager.createChannel{value: fee}(
    "My Channel",
    "Description",
    "{}",
    address(0)
);
```

- See the full example [here](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/examples/snippets/solidity/CreateChannel.s.sol).
