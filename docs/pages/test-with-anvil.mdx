# Test with Anvil

Anvil is a local Ethereum node that is used for testing and development.
It comes with `foundry` and is a perfect tool for local testing and development.

You can get started by installing `foundryup` which is a tool to install [`foundry`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

Once you have `foundry` installed, you can start the anvil node by running:

```bash
anvil
```

Then you can deploy our `CommentManager` contract to the anvil node by running:

```bash
cd packages/protocol
forge script script/Dev.s.sol:DevScript --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
```

**Please note that every time anvil shuts down, it will reset the blockchain state. You will need to re-deploy the contract.**

You can also combine above 2 steps by running `pnpm run dev` in `/packages/protocol/`,
