# Spam Prevention

> **Important Note**: The protocol itself does not perform any moderation. Each application (demo, embed, or custom implementations) is responsible for implementing their own moderation strategies using the tools provided below or through their own mechanisms.

This document outlines the spam prevention mechanisms implemented across different components of the system.

## Apps (Demo & Embed)

The demo and embed applications implement two basic levels of spam prevention:

1. **Rate Limiting**

   - Comments are rate-limited per author address
   - When rate limit is exceeded, requests return a 429 status code with a `Retry-After` header

2. **Content Filtering (Opt in)**
   - Basic profanity detection using the `obscenity` library
   - Comments containing profane words are rejected
   - This is a simple implementation and can be enhanced with more sophisticated content filtering

## Indexer Service

The indexer service implements additional spam prevention measures:

1. **Muted Address Detection**

   - Maintains a list of known muted addresses that you can mark in order to hide them from your app
   - Comments from addresses marked as muted are not indexed
   - Muted accounts can be managed using the [Admin CLI](/indexer/admin-cli-muted-accounts)

2. **Content Validation (Opt in)**

   - Implements basic profanity detection
   - Can be extended with more advanced content analysis

3. **Comment Premoderation (Opt in)**

   - Comments can be configured to require moderator approval before appearing in the feed
   - When enabled, new comments are initially hidden and only become visible after explicit approval
   - Moderators can approve or reject comments through the [Admin CLI](/indexer/admin-cli-comments-premoderation) or directly through [Indexer API](/indexer-reference/restful)
   - This provides an additional layer of control over content quality and spam prevention

## Recommendations

For production deployments, consider implementing additional spam prevention measures:

- Machine learning-based content analysis
- IP-based rate limiting
- CAPTCHA or similar challenge-response systems
- User reputation scoring
- Advanced pattern matching for spam detection
