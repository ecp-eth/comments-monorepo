# Spam Prevention

This document outlines the spam prevention mechanisms implemented across different components of the system.

## Apps (Demo & Embed)

The demo and embed applications implement two basic levels of spam prevention:

1. **Rate Limiting**

   - Comments are rate-limited per author address
   - When rate limit is exceeded, requests return a 429 status code with a `Retry-After` header

2. **Content Filtering**
   - Basic profanity detection using the `obscenity` library
   - Comments containing profane words are rejected
   - This is a simple implementation and can be enhanced with more sophisticated content filtering

## Indexer Service

The indexer service implements additional spam prevention measures:

1. **Spammer Address Detection**

   - Maintains a list of known spammer addresses
   - Comments from addresses marked as spammers are not indexer
   - Spammers can be managed using the [Admin CLI](/indexer/admin-cli-spammers)

2. **Content Validation**
   - Implements basic profanity detection
   - Can be extended with more advanced content analysis

## Recommendations

For production deployments, consider implementing additional spam prevention measures:

- Machine learning-based content analysis
- IP-based rate limiting
- CAPTCHA or similar challenge-response systems
- User reputation scoring
- Advanced pattern matching for spam detection
