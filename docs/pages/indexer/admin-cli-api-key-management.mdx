# Admin CLI - API Key Management

The Admin CLI provides tools to manage API keys for the indexer service. API keys are used to authenticate requests to protected endpoints of the indexer.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Access to the indexer database
- Checked out the [Comments mono repository](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo)

## Database Connection

All commands require a database connection. You can provide the database URL in two ways:

1. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
2. Use the `-d` or `--db-url` option with each command

## Commands

### Adding a New API Key

To add a new API key, use the following command:

```bash
bin/admin.js auth accounts add <name>
```

Replace `<name>` with a descriptive name for the API key.

Example:

```bash
bin/admin.js auth accounts add "production-api-key"
```

The command will output:

- ID: Unique identifier for the API key
- Name: The name you provided
- Private key: The private key (store this securely)
- Public key: The public key

⚠️ **Important**: Save the private key immediately after creation. It will not be shown again.

### Listing API Keys

To list all existing API keys:

```bash
bin/admin.js auth accounts list
```

This will display a table with:

- ID: The unique identifier
- Created at: Timestamp of creation
- Last used at: Timestamp of last usage

### Deleting an API Key

To delete an API key:

```bash
bin/admin.js auth accounts delete <id>
```

Replace `<id>` with the ID of the API key you want to delete.

Example:

```bash
bin/admin.js auth accounts delete abc123def456
```

## Using API Keys

When making requests to protected endpoints, you'll need to include the API key in the request headers:

- `X-API-Key`: The API key ID
- `X-API-Timestamp`: Current timestamp in milliseconds
- `X-API-Signature`: A signature generated using the private key

The signature is created by:

1. Concatenating the HTTP method, path, timestamp, and request body
2. Converting the string to bytes
3. Signing the bytes with the private key using Ed25519

## Security Best Practices

1. Store private keys securely and never share them
2. Use descriptive names for API keys to track their purpose
3. Regularly rotate API keys
4. Delete unused API keys
5. Use different API keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
