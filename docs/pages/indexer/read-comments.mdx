# Read Comments from the Indexer

To accommodate different use cases, the ECP offers multiple ways to read comments from the indexer.

## Typescript SDK

The Typescript SDK provides a set of functions to read comments and replies from the indexer.

See [Typescript SDK](/integration-options/typescript-sdk) for more details.

## REST API

The REST API endpoints are available at `https://api.ethcomments.xyz/**/*`.

See [REST API Reference](/indexer-reference/restful) for more details.

## Direct GraphQL access

The GraphQL API is available at `https://api.ethcomments.xyz/graphql`.

You can query the data using [your favorite GraphQL client](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql),
or simply visit the GraphQL playground at https://api.ethcomments.xyz/ to try it out.

### Example queries

Query a comment by its ID:

```graphql
query {
  comment(
    id: "0xc4f012eaaa9285b0ffa7df432a7eb8f17145c34cfd50de688273b2b7df6bef08"
  ) {
    content
  }
}
```

Filter comments by `targetUri` and limit the number of results:

```graphql
query {
  comments(where: { targetUri: "https://demo.ethcomments.xyz" }, limit: 10) {
    # pagination info
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
    }

    # comment details
    items {
      id
      content
    }

    # total number of comments filtered by targetUri
    totalCount
  }
}
```

## Direct database access via ponder client

Ponder access is available at `https://api.ethcomments.xyz/sql`, it allows you to query the indexer database directly.

You can use direct database access for quick investigations and debugging, but this approach is not recommended for production use since the database schema may change without notice. Changes to the schema could break your queries and affect application stability.

### Install `ponder` and `@ponder/client`

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install ponder @ponder/client
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add ponder @ponder/client
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add ponder @ponder/client

```

:::

`ponder` package is required by the schema file.

### Get a copy of the database schema

We are currently working on determining the best way to distribute the database schema. In the meantime, you can obtain it by cloning our repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo.git
```

The schema is located at `comments-monorepo/apps/indexer/ponder.schema.ts`.

### Create a ponder client and query

```
import { createClient, sql } from "@ponder/client";
import * as schema from "./schema";

// create a ponder client with specified schema
const client = createClient("https://api.ethcomments.xyz/sql", { schema });

// query the database for comments
const result = await client.db.select()
  .from(schema.comment)
  // filter comments by target uri
  .where(sql`${schema.comment.targetUri} = 'https://demo.ethcomments.xyz'`)
  // limit the result to 10
  .limit(10);

console.log(result)
```

See detailed explanation of ponder client at [Ponder client](https://ponder.sh/docs/query/client).
