# Admin CLI

The Indexer provides an admin CLI tool (`bin/admin.js`) for managing various aspects of an indexer instance. This tool requires proper authentication using API keys.

## Prerequisites

Before using the admin CLI commands, you need:

- Access to the indexer service
- Checked out the [Comments mono repository](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo)

## Usage

To see available commands and their descriptions:

```bash
bin/admin.js help
```

## Common Options

Most admin CLI commands require the following options:

- `-i, --id <id>` - The ID of the API key to use (required)
- `-k, --private-key <key>` - The private key of the API key (required)
- `-u, --url <url>` - The URL of the indexer service (default: https://api.ethcomments.xyz)

## Error Handling

If any command fails, the CLI will:

1. Display an error message with details about the failure
2. Exit with a non-zero status code

Common error scenarios include:

- Invalid API key or private key
- Network connectivity issues
- Server-side errors
- Invalid command arguments

## Security Notes

- Keep your API private keys secure and never share them
- Use environment variables or secure key management systems to store sensitive credentials
- The CLI uses Ed25519 signatures for authentication
- All requests are timestamped to prevent replay attacks
