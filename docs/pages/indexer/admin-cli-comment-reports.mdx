# Comment Reports Management

The Indexer's Admin CLI provides commands to manage comment reports through the `reports` command group. This allows administrators to view and manage reports submitted by users regarding comments.

## Prerequisites

Before using the reports management commands, ensure you have:

- Access to the indexer service
- An API key with appropriate permissions
- The Comments mono repository checked out

## Common Options

All reports management commands require the following options:

- `-i, --id <id>` - The ID of the API key to use (required)
- `-k, --private-key <key>` - The private key of the API key (required)
- `-u, --url <url>` - The URL of the indexer service (default: https://api.ethcomments.xyz)

## Available Commands

### List Reports

View all pending reports:

```bash
bin/admin.js reports list
```

This command displays a list of pending reports with the following information for each report:

- Report ID
- Creation timestamp
- Reportee address
- Report message (if provided)

### Close Report

Mark a report as closed without taking action:

```bash
bin/admin.js reports close <reportId>
```

This command changes the status of a report to "closed". Use this when a report doesn't require any action.

### Resolve Report

Mark a report as resolved after taking appropriate action:

```bash
bin/admin.js reports resolve <reportId>
```

This command changes the status of a report to "resolved". Use this when you've taken action on the report (e.g., [moderating the reported comment](/indexer/admin-cli-comments-premoderation)).

## Error Handling

The CLI will handle errors by:

1. Displaying an error message with details about the failure
2. Exiting with a non-zero status code

Common error scenarios include:

- Invalid API key or private key
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid report IDs
- Server-side errors

## Security Notes

- Keep your API private keys secure and never share them
- All requests are authenticated using Ed25519 signatures
- Requests are timestamped to prevent replay attacks
