Ethereum Comments Protocol enables the users to comment on any URI across the web.
Website and dApp developers can easily integrate this protocol to add commenting functionality to their platforms while keeping user data decentralized and user-owned.

## What's in the box?

- **🌐 Universal**: Comment on anything that can be represented as a URI (websites, articles, NFTs, or any web resource)
- **🔗 Decentralized**: User-owned content and identity, with decentralized storage on the blockchains
- **⚡️ Developer-Friendly**: Simple drop-in integration for websites and dApps
- **🤝 Open-Source**: The protocol is open-source and community-driven, allowing anyone to build on top of it
