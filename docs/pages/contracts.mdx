# Comments Protocol Contract

The contracts are currently only deployed on the Base Sepolia as we decide where to deploy the production contracts.

## Importing ABIs

You can import the contract ABIs directly from the SDK:

```typescript
import { CommentManagerABI, ChannelManagerABI } from "@ecp.eth/sdk/abis";
```
