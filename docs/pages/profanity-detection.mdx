# Profanity Detection

By default, the protocol does not include profanity detection to remain neutral and accommodate multi-language communities.
This design choice helps avoid potential false positives that can occur with language-specific profanity filters.

## Implementing Your Own Filter

You can guard against profane comments in two places:

1. When the app signer signs the comment — this prevents the comment from being broadcast to the network.
2. When the comment is returned to the app — this prevents it from being displayed to users.

Taking the comment signing API as an example (see our [demo app](<(https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/main/apps/demo/src/app/api/sign-comment/route.ts)>)),
you can add profanity detection by filtering the comment content using a zod schema:

```typescript
const CommentSchema = z.object({
  author: HexSchema,
  content: z
    .string()
    .trim()
    .nonempty()
    .refine((val) => !isProfane(val), "Comment contains profanity"),
});
```

Use it in your comment signing API to parse the request body:

```typescript
const parseResult = CommentSchema.safeParse(await req.json());
```

Choose a solution that best fits your community's language and moderation needs. Remember to:

- Test thoroughly to minimize false positives
- Consider maintaining custom word lists
- Allow for cultural and linguistic context
- Consider implementing an appeals process for false positives
