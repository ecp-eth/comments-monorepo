# Rules for choosing an appropriate `targetUri`

Be careful when choosing the value for the `targetUri` property as
the `targetUri` serves as a unique identifier to locate comments,
inconsistent `targetUri` will result in some comments missing from the indexer response:

1. The `uri` must be a unique string that follows the [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) standard.
2. If your web page is dynamic and accepts query parameters, you should carefully consider which parameters are necessary to locate the correct comments. As a general rule:
   1. Include query parameters that affect the page content into the `targetUri`.
   2. Arrange them in consistent order.
