## Dual-signature System

The protocol implements a dual-signature system that allows comment authors to delegate comment actions to app server. When an author approves an app signer, that app server can perform actions like posting comments on behalf of the author. This enables features like gasless transactions while maintaining security through cryptographic signatures.

### Author Signer

The author signer represents the party who creates and owns the comments, its responsibilities are:

- Create and own comments
- Signs transactions to post comments directly
- Can approve or revoke app signers

### App Signer

The app signer represents the party who owns the app or community, its responsibilities are:

- Authorize comments to be associated with the application
- Can be approved to post comments on behalf of an author
- This app signer can be used as a filter to only show comments signed by your app, from a group of apps, or any app (in which case a spam mechanism is advisable).

#### Single Player Mode

If you're building an app just for yourself—like a personal blog where only you will post—you can simplify things by using your author signer as your app signer.

In this setup, the same signer is responsible for generating both the author signature (proving authorship of content) and the app signature (authorizing the content to be posted to an app).
This approach reduces setup complexity while maintaining full functionality for solo use.

### Submitter

The app server backend can use a separate submitter wallet to pay for the gas fee.

- A backend wallet that pays for gas
- Executes transactions on behalf of authors or apps
- Enables gasless operations when combined with signatures
