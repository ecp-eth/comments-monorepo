## Dual-signature System

The protocol implements a dual-signature system that allows comment authors to delegate comment actions to dApps. When an author approves an app signer, that dApp can perform actions like posting comments on behalf of the author. This enables features like gasless transactions while maintaining security through cryptographic signatures.

### Author Signer
- The end user's wallet that creates and owns the comments
- Signs transactions to post comments directly
- Can approve or revoke app signers
- Optional if the author pays for the gas fee

### App Signer
- A backend-controlled wallet that approves and signs comments
- Can be approved/revoked by authors

### Submitter

The dApp backend can use a separate submitter wallet to pay for the gas fee.

- A backend wallet that pays for gas
- Executes transactions on behalf of authors or apps
- Enables gasless operations when combined with signatures
