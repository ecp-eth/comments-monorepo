# Integration Options

## Indexer Webhooks

Manage your apps, webhooks, and deliveries at `https://dashboard.ethcomments.xyz`.

### What you configure

- **App**: A container for your webhooks. Each app has a generated secret used to sign deliveries.
- **Webhook**: Subscribes to one or more event types and delivers to your HTTPS endpoint. Supports auth (no auth, HTTP Basic, or a custom header).
- **Deliveries**: Individual attempts to send an event to your endpoint. Logged with status, response code, and retries.

### Delivery semantics

- **Ordering**: In-order delivery per webhook subscription (FIFO per subscription identifier).
- **Non-blocking**: A failed delivery does not block subsequent events for that subscription.
- **Retries**: Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff up to 20 total attempts.
- **Timeouts**: Request timeout is 5 seconds per attempt.
- **Success**: Any 2xx–3xx status code is treated as success; redirects are not followed.
- **Idempotency**: Each event includes a `uid` you can use to deduplicate.

### Event schema and SDK

Use the SDK to parse and verify webhook requests and access strongly typed events.

- SDK reference: see [@ecp.eth/sdk/indexer/webhooks](/sdk-reference/indexer/webhooks/index.mdx).
  - Functions: [`constructEventFromRequest`](/sdk-reference/indexer/webhooks/functions/constructEventFromRequest.mdx), [`constructEvent`](/sdk-reference/indexer/webhooks/functions/constructEvent.mdx)
  - Event types and schemas: see the [Type Aliases](/sdk-reference/indexer/webhooks/index.mdx#type-aliases) and [Variables](/sdk-reference/indexer/webhooks/index.mdx#variables) on the same page (e.g., [`CommentAddedEvent`](/sdk-reference/indexer/webhooks/type-aliases/CommentAddedEvent.mdx), [`ChannelCreatedEvent`](/sdk-reference/indexer/webhooks/type-aliases/ChannelCreatedEvent.mdx), etc.).

#### Verify and parse in a Next.js/Fetch handler

```ts
import { constructEventFromRequest } from "@ecp.eth/sdk/indexer/webhooks";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Your app secret from the Indexer App dashboard
  const event = await constructEventFromRequest({
    appSecret: process.env.APP_SECRET!,
    request,
  });

  switch (event.event) {
    case "comment:added":
      // handle event.data
      break;
    case "channel:created":
      // ...
      break;
  }

  return new Response("ok");
}
```

#### Verify and parse with raw headers/body

```ts
import { constructEvent } from "@ecp.eth/sdk/indexer/webhooks";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.text();
  const signature = request.headers.get("x-ecp-webhook-signature")!;
  const timestamp = request.headers.get("x-ecp-webhook-timestamp")!;

  const event = constructEvent({
    appSecret: process.env.APP_SECRET!,
    requestBody: body,
    requestSignature: signature,
    requestTimestamp: timestamp,
  });

  return new Response("ok");
}
```

See the SDK pages for the exact shapes of all events and fields.

### Authentication to your endpoint

- **No auth**: No headers added by the Indexer.
- **HTTP Basic**: We will send the `Authorization: Basic ...` header you configure.
- **Custom header**: Provide a name and value; we will include that header with every delivery.

Configure these per webhook in the dashboard at `https://dashboard.ethcomments.xyz`.

### Data stored and retention

- We store the app name and its generated secret key.
- For each webhook: name, endpoint URL, subscribed event types, selected authentication config, and delivery logs.
- When you delete a webhook, its delivery logs are deleted. When you delete an app, its webhooks and logs are deleted.

### Recommendations

- Validate the signature for each request using the SDK.
- Use `uid` for idempotency to safely handle retries.
- Respond quickly (under 5s) and perform heavy work asynchronously.
- Make your endpoint highly available and accept JSON requests over HTTPS.

### Managing and testing

- Create apps, add webhooks, and view delivery logs at `https://dashboard.ethcomments.xyz`.
- Use the dashboard to send a "Test" event to verify your endpoint. The test payload type is documented at [`TestEvent`](/sdk-reference/indexer/webhooks/type-aliases/TestEvent.mdx).
