# Integration Options

## Contract Interaction

In certain situations, such as bot development or custom integrations, you may want to directly interact with the CommentsV1 smart contract.

### Contract Addresses

See [COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS](/sdk-reference/defaultExports/variables/COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS)

### Post the comment as author

We will start by create a simple example that simulates the author posting a comment that is signed by an app server.

The ECP supports 4 types of comment posting flows, each with their own pros and cons.
You may want to read more about the [post comment flows](/post-comment-flows) for more details.

Here we will show the simplest flow:

- The author posts and pays for gas, see ["author pays gas"](/post-comment-flows#1-author-pays-gas).
- The app server authorises the post by signing the comment data.

::::steps

#### Install tooling

In this example we will use `@ecp.eth/sdk` and `viem` to interact with the contract:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install viem "@ecp.eth/sdk"
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add viem "@ecp.eth/sdk"
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add viem "@ecp.eth/sdk"

```

#### Simulate the App Server signing the post

For the app to sign and authorize posting, we will need the following information:

- The author's address
- The target chain for posting the comment
- The comment content
- The target URI of the comment

Let's create a function that signs comments for the app server. Here's the function signature:

```typescript
type sign = (
  authorAddress: Hex,
  chain: Chain,
  content: string,
  targetUri: string
) => Promise<{
  signature: Hex;
  commentData: CommentData;
}>;
```

Now let's get the comment data ready for signing...

Frist create a `CommentData` object with the provided info:

```typescript
const commentData = createCommentData({
  content,
  targetUri,
  // we are posting a top level comment, so no parentId
  parentId: undefined,
  author: authorAddress,
  appSigner: appSigner.address,
});
```

Then create a typed data structure from `commentData` according to EIP-712:

```typescript
const typedCommentData = createCommentTypedData({
  commentData,
  chainId: chain.id,
});
```

Finally, sign the typed data using the app signer's private key and return both `signature` and `commentData`:

```typescript
const signature = await appSigner.signTypedData(typedCommentData);

return {
  signature,
  commentData,
};
```

Here is the complete module of the app server class:

```typescript
import { Hex, Chain } from "viem";
import { createCommentData, createCommentTypedData } from "@ecp.eth/sdk";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";

/**
 * The class simulate the app server that signs the comment.
 * However in real scenario, the app server is deployed by a different party,
 * and the communication was done via HTTP or other transport.
 * The app signing process should be hide away from the client.
 */
export class AppServer {
  private readonly appSignerPrivateKey =
    "0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80";
  private readonly appSigner = privateKeyToAccount(this.appSignerPrivateKey);

  /**
   * Sign the comment data as the app server
   * @param authorAddress - The address of the author of the comment
   * @param chain - The chain on which the comment is being posted
   * @param content - The content of the comment
   * @param targetUri - The URI of the target of the comment
   * @returns The signed comment data
   */
  async sign(
    authorAddress: Hex,
    chain: Chain,
    content: string,
    targetUri: string
  ) {
    const appSigner = this.appSigner;

    // create comment data
    const commentData = createCommentData({
      content,
      targetUri,
      // we are posting a top level comment, so no parentId
      parentId: undefined,
      author: authorAddress,
      appSigner: appSigner.address,
    });

    // create a typed data according to EIP-712 for signing
    const typedCommentData = createCommentTypedData({
      commentData,
      chainId: chain.id,
    });

    const signature = await appSigner.signTypedData(typedCommentData);

    return {
      signature,
      commentData,
    };
  }
}
```

**Note**: Do not expose the app signer's private key in the client side in real scenario,
here we simplified the setup and this is only for demostration purpose

Now that we have finished implementing the App Server, let's move on to the client side.

#### Get access to the blockchain with RPC endpoint

Get blockchain node's RPC endpoint URL, create a `transport` for `viem`:

```typescript
const transport = http(rpcEndpoint);
```

See [Test with Anvil](/test-with-anvil) for if you want to setup a local blockchain node for testing.

#### Create wallet client for signing the transaction

To interact with the blockchain and the contract, we will create an `account/signer`,
to create a `wallet client` which allows us to sign and send transaction to the blockchain.

To create an `account`, for simplicity and demostration purpose, we will use a hard coded private key:

```typescript
const authorPrivateKey =
  "0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d";
const authorSigner = privateKeyToAccount(authorPrivateKey);
```

Please note that in real scenario, you probably want to connect to a user's wallet app, such as MetaMask or Rainbow, to sign and send the transaction.
To see how to do that, please refer to:

1. viem's documentation on [JSON RPC accounts](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet#json-rpc-accounts), and
1. Reown's [Ethereum RPC Provider](https://docs.reown.com/advanced/providers/ethereum)
1. Or use [Rainbowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/custom-wallet-list#walletconnect)

Then combine `transport` and `account/signer` to create a `viem` wallet client:

```typescript
// Create wallet client for interacting with the contract
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: anvil,
  transport,
  account: authorSigner,
});
```

We will use the wallet client later in the tutorial.

#### Simulate the Author posting the comment

This is the function signature for the author to post the comment:

```typescript
type postComment(appServer: AppServer, content: string, targetUri: string) => Promise<TransactionReceipt>
```

We will start by sending the comment data to the App Server for signing.

In the real scenario, the client side posts the data to the server via HTTP or whatever transport of your choice,
usually the App Server is deployed by a different party to keep the private key secure.

However, to demonstrate the flow in this example, we'll directly call the `sign` function from the `AppServer` instance.

```typescript
const appSignedComment = await appServer.sign(
  authorSigner.address,
  anvil,
  content,
  targetUri
);
```

Then we call the function on the contract to post the comment, and wait for the transaction to be confirmed:

```typescript
// Get contract instance
const commentsContract = getContract({
  address: COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS,
  abi: CommentsV1Abi,
  client: walletClient,
});

const tx = await commentsContract.write.postCommentAsAuthor(
  [appSignedComment.commentData, appSignedComment.signature],
  {
    account: walletClient.account,
  }
);

const receipt = await waitForTransactionReceipt(walletClient, {
  hash: tx,
});

return receipt;
```

#### Put everything together

Here is the complete example, with everything put together:

```typescript
import { http, createWalletClient, getContract } from "viem";
import { anvil } from "viem/chains";
import { waitForTransactionReceipt } from "viem/actions";
import { COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS } from "@ecp.eth/sdk";
import { CommentsV1Abi } from "@ecp.eth/sdk/abis";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { AppServer } from "./appServer";

// we use a local anvil node for this example,
// anvil is a local ethereum node that is used for testing and development.
// run `pnpm i && pnpm run dev` in `/packages/protocol/` to start the node,
// the script will also deploy the contract to the node
const transport = http("http://localhost:8545");

/**
 * The function simulates the author who posts the comment from client side
 */
async function postCommentAsAuthor(
  appServer: AppServer,
  content: string,
  targetUri: string
) {
  const authorPrivateKey =
    "0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d";
  const authorSigner = privateKeyToAccount(authorPrivateKey);
  // Create wallet client for interacting with the contract
  const walletClient = createWalletClient({
    chain: anvil,
    transport,
    account: authorSigner,
  });

  // to begin with, we post the comment data over to app server,
  // to get the app server signed comment data
  const appSignedComment = await appServer.sign(
    authorSigner.address,
    anvil,
    content,
    targetUri
  );

  // Get contract instance
  const commentsContract = getContract({
    address: COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS,
    abi: CommentsV1Abi,
    client: walletClient,
  });

  // post comment data and app signature so the contract can verify the comment is authorized by the app
  const tx = await commentsContract.write.postCommentAsAuthor(
    [appSignedComment.commentData, appSignedComment.signature],
    {
      // postCommentAsAuthor transaction will be executed by author signer so the author will have to pay.
      account: walletClient.account,
    }
  );

  const receipt = await waitForTransactionReceipt(walletClient, {
    hash: tx,
  });

  return receipt;
}
```

and let's test the example:

```typescript
const server = new AppServer();

console.log("author is posting the comment...");

const receipt = await postCommentAsAuthor(
  server,
  "Somebody successfully finished the tutorial!",
  "https://demo.ethcomments.xyz"
);

console.log(
  "author has posted the comment and the transaction is mined, transaction hash: ",
  receipt.transactionHash
);
```

#### Congratulations! You've completed the tutorial!

### Best Practices

1. Set reasonable deadlines (e.g., 1 hour from current time)
1. Implement proper error handling
1. Monitor gas costs and adjust gas limits accordingly
1. Consider implementing retry mechanisms for failed transactions
1. Keep private keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
1. While the contract doesn't impose rate limits, consider implementing application-level rate limiting to prevent spam and manage gas costs effectively.
1. Consider anti-spam measures

#### Next Steps

- Check out **gasless** [post comment flows](/post-comment-flows)
- See [Protocol API Reference](/protocol-reference/CommentsV1) for more functions and details.
- See [Demo App Source Code](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/apps/demo) for implementations of:
  1. The other post comment flows.
  2. Request permission from the user for gasless posting.
  3. Deleting comments.
