## Contract Interaction

### Delete a comment

We will use code snippets from the [demo app](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/apps/demo) to illustrate the process of deleting a comment.

### The Contract

- For latest contract address, see [COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS](/sdk-reference/defaultExports/variables/COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS).
- Use [`deleteComment()`](/protocol-reference/CommentsV1#deletecommentbytes32-commentid-address-author-address-appsigner-uint256-nonce-uint256-deadline-bytes-authorsignature-bytes-appsignature-external) method to delete a comment with a author signature.
- Use [`deleteCommentAsAuthor()`](/protocol-reference/CommentsV1#deletecommentasauthorbytes32-commentid-external) method to delete a comment provided that it was called by the author.

/apps/demo/src/components/comments/Comment.tsx#L91

#### 1. Prepare the Delete Operation

First, make a request to prepare the delete operation. This will generate the necessary typed data and signatures:

```typescript
// Make a POST request to /api/delete-comment/prepare
const response = await fetch("/api/delete-comment/prepare", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    author: authorAddress,
    commentId: commentIdToDelete,
    submitIfApproved: true, // Set to true to auto-submit if user is already approved
  }),
});

const data = await response.json();
```

The prepare endpoint will:

1. Generate the typed data for deletion
2. Sign it with the app signer
3. If `submitIfApproved` is true and the user is approved, submit the transaction directly
4. Otherwise, return the signed data for the user to sign

#### 2. Handle the Response

The prepare endpoint will return one of two responses:

```typescript
// If user is approved and submitIfApproved=true:
{
  txHash: `0x${string}` // The transaction hash of the submitted deletion
}

// If user needs to sign:
{
  signTypedDataParams: TypedData, // The typed data to be signed
  appSignature: `0x${string}`, // The app signer's signature
}
```

#### 3. Get User Signature

If the user needs to sign (not already approved), have them sign the typed data:

```typescript
// Using wagmi hooks
const { signTypedData } = useSignTypedData();

const authorSignature = await signTypedData(signTypedDataParams);
```

#### 4. Submit the Delete Transaction

Finally, submit the delete transaction with both signatures:

```typescript
const deleteResponse = await fetch("/api/delete-comment", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    signTypedDataParams,
    appSignature,
    authorSignature,
  }),
});

const { txHash } = await deleteResponse.json();
```

The server will verify both signatures and submit the transaction to delete the comment.

#### Implementation Details

The server-side implementation in the demo app shows how to:

1. Verify signatures
2. Submit the transaction using a submitter account
3. Handle errors appropriately

Here's the relevant server code:

```typescript:apps/demo/src/app/api/delete-comment/route.ts
// ... existing code ...
try {
  const txHash = await walletClient.writeContract({
    abi: CommentsV1Abi,
    address: COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS,
    functionName: "deleteComment",
    args: [
      signTypedDataParams.message.commentId,
      signTypedDataParams.message.author,
      signTypedDataParams.message.appSigner,
      signTypedDataParams.message.nonce,
      signTypedDataParams.message.deadline,
      authorSignature,
      appSignature,
    ],
  });

  return new JSONResponse(DeleteCommentResponseSchema, { txHash });
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);

  return new JSONResponse(
    InternalServerErrorResponseSchema,
    { error: "Failed to delete comment" },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
// ... existing code ...
```

This implementation ensures that:

- Both the app signer and user have signed the deletion
- The signatures are valid
- The transaction is submitted properly
- Errors are handled appropriately

For a complete working example, refer to the [demo app source code](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/apps/demo).
