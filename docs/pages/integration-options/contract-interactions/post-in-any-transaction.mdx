## Contract Interaction

### Post comment in any Ethereum transaction

In certain cases, you may want to attach a comment to an Ethereum transaction. This is useful for:

- Saving gas cost by including the comment in the transaction calldata
- Adding comments to NFT mints
- Commenting on token transfers
- Adding context to any smart contract interaction

In this document, we will walkthrough the code from the [demo app](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/apps/demo)
to illustrate the process of posting a comment as part of any transaction.

### The Contract

- For latest contract address, see [COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS](/sdk-reference/defaultExports/variables/COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS).

### How it works

The demo app uses a test contract with the method `yoink()` to illustrate how to include a comment in a transaction.
For a detailed explanation of the flow, see the [Post Comment Flows](/post-comment-flows#4-appending-comment-to-a-transaction-author-pays-gas).

1. The author creates a signed comment data by sending it to the app server for signing.
1. The author encodes the signed comment data into a hex string.
1. The author calls the `yoink()` method on the contract and passes the encoded comment data as calldata suffix.
1. Once the transaction is broadcasted, the comment in calldata will then be indexed by our ponder indexer.

For dependencies and test environment setup, please refer to previous [examples in this section](/integration-options/contract-interactions).

#### Test contract

The test contract source code is available in the [test-protocol package](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/packages/test-protocol).

Should you want to deploy your test contract, follow the steps in the [README file](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/main/packages/test-protocol/README.md),
then update the address used for the demo app in the `.env` files:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOINK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
```

**Note:** Test contract deployment is not strictly needed for testing as currently, the indexer will just scan all transactions with the [ECP delimiter](/sdk-reference/defaultExports/variables/COMMENT_CALLDATA_SUFFIX_DELIMITER),
and index the comment data if it finds one. So even if the test contract is not deployed, everything will still work as long as the transaction is broadcasted to the network.

Now let's get started with the code!

::::steps

#### Get the comment data signed by the app server

As all previous examples, the author will start by collecting the required
[comment data](/comment-data-props) and send it to the app server for signing:

```typescript
const response = await fetch("/api/sign-comment", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    content,
    targetUri: window.location.href,
    parentId,
    author: address,
    chainId,
  }),
});
```

🧑‍💻 _[/apps/demo/src/components/comments/CommentBox.tsx#L62](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/094bcde2bca079bd7451c6571f26c5687b2ad128/apps/demo/src/components/comments/CommentBox.tsx#L62)_

#### Encode the comment data

Next, we want to encode signed comment data into hex using `encodeAbiParameters` with the ABI definition of the comment data,
luckily we have a helper function `createCommentSuffixData` from the SDKto do just that:

```typescript
const commentDataSuffix = createCommentSuffixData({
  commentData,
  appSignature,
});
```

🧑‍💻 _[/apps/demo/src/lib/contract.ts#L21-L24](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/094bcde2bca079bd7451c6571f26c5687b2ad128/apps/demo/src/lib/contract.ts#L21-L24)_

#### Include a comment in your transaction

Now you can create the test contract instance and include the encoded comment data in your transaction's data field:

```typescript
return await writeContractAsync({
  address:
    publicEnv.NEXT_PUBLIC_YOINK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS ??
    never("Yoink contract address is not set"),
  abi: parseAbi(["function yoink()"]),
  functionName: "yoink",
  args: [],
  dataSuffix: commentDataSuffix,
});
```

🧑‍💻 _[/apps/demo/src/lib/contract.ts#L26-L33](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/094bcde2bca079bd7451c6571f26c5687b2ad128/apps/demo/src/lib/contract.ts#L26-L33)_

and wait for the transaction to be mined:

```typescript
const { data: receipt, isLoading: isReceiptLoading } =
  useWaitForTransactionReceipt({
    hash: submitMutation.data?.txHash,
  });
```

🧑‍💻 _[/apps/demo/src/components/comments/CommentBox.tsx#L113-L116](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/094bcde2bca079bd7451c6571f26c5687b2ad128/apps/demo/src/components/comments/CommentBox.tsx#L113-L116)_

The comments indexer will scan transactions for valid comment data and index any comments it finds, making them available through the indexer API.

#### Testing the integration

You can verify your integration by:

1. Checking the indexer API (or [deploy indexer locally](/indexer-reference)) to see if the comment was indexed
1. Viewing the comment on your app's UI

#### Congrats! You've completed the tutorial!
