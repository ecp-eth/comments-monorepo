# Contract Interaction

This guide explains how to directly interact with the CommentsV1 smart contract for custom integrations or bot development.

## Contract Addresses

See [COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS](/sdk-reference/default/variables/COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS)

## Setup

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install wagmi viem
# or
pnpm add wagmi viem
```

## Basic Setup Code

```typescript
import { createConfig, configureChains } from "wagmi";
import { baseMainnet } from "wagmi/chains";
import { publicProvider } from "wagmi/providers/public";
import { CommentsV1Abi } from "@ecp.eth/protocol/abi";

// Configure chains & providers
const { chains, publicClient } = configureChains(
  [baseMainnet],
  [publicProvider()]
);

// Create wagmi config
const config = createConfig({
  autoConnect: true,
  publicClient,
});

// Contract config
const contractAddress = "0xfed9b3a3884940d0c8a91b55f5e631b33a84f669"; // Base mainnet
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use fresh nonces by querying them before each operation
2. Set reasonable deadlines (e.g., 1 hour from current time)
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Monitor gas costs and adjust gas limits accordingly
5. Consider implementing retry mechanisms for failed transactions
6. Keep private keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
7. While the contract doesn't impose rate limits, consider implementing application-level rate limiting to prevent spam and manage gas costs effectively.
8. Considering anti-spam measures
