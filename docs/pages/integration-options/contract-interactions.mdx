## Contract Interaction

### Post the comment as the author

In this section, we will walkthrough the code from the [demo app](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/apps/demo) to illustrate the process of posting a comment as the author.

The ECP supports 4 types of comment posting flows, each with its pros and cons.

Here we will discuss [the simplest flow](/post-comment-flows#1-author-pays-gas):

- The author posts and pays for gas, see ["author pays for the gas"](/post-comment-flows#1-author-pays-gas).
- The app server authorizes the post by signing the comment data.

You may want to read more about the [post comment flows](/post-comment-flows) for more details.

#### The Contract

- For latest contract address, see [COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS](/sdk-reference/defaultExports/variables/COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS).
- We will call [`postCommentAsAuthor()`](/protocol-reference/CommentsV1#postcommentasauthorstruct-commentsv1commentdata-commentdata-bytes-appsignature-external) method to post the comment.

#### Demo Dependencies

Here is a quick rundown of some of the dependencies used in the demo app:

1. `@ecp.eth/sdk` - for comment data creation, retrieving, and interaction with the indexer.
1. `wagmi` - for react based wallet connection
1. `viem` - for contract interaction
1. `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` - for wallet connection UI
1. `@tanstack/react-query` - for data fetching and caching

#### Test environment

- We use [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) for local testing and development, follow the steps in [Test with Anvil](/test-with-anvil) to set up the environment.
- You may want to set up an indexer locally as well, see [Indexer](/indexer-reference/) for more details.

Now let's go through the steps to post a comment!

::::steps

##### Collect the comment data and send it to the server for signing

We will start by collecting the [comment data](/comment-data-props) and send it to the server for signing:

The comment data is sent to the server for signing:

```typescript
const response = await fetch("/api/sign-comment", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    content,
    targetUri: window.location.href,
    parentId,
    author: address,
    chainId,
  }),
});
```

üßë‚Äçüíª _[/apps/demo/src/components/comments/queries.ts#L71](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/edc87c0725eb08e199dd206d278fbfc932050eb4/apps/demo/src/components/comments/queries.ts#L71)_

##### The App Server signs the comment data

Once the data reaches the app server, it creates a `CommentData` with `nonce` generated from `getNonce`, using `createCommentData` from `@ecp.eth/sdk`:

```typescript
const nonce = await getNonce({
  author,
  appSigner: appSigner.address,
  chain,
});

const commentData = createCommentData({
  content,
  targetUri,
  parentId,
  author,
  appSigner: appSigner.address,
  nonce,
});
```

See [`Comment Data`](/comment-data-props) for more details on the properties of the comment data.

Create a typed data structure from `commentData` according to EIP-712:

```typescript
const typedCommentData = createCommentTypedData({
  commentData,
  chainId: chain.id,
});
```

Finally, sign the typed data using the app signer's private key and return both `signature` and `commentData`:

```typescript
const signature = await appSigner.signTypedData(typedCommentData);

return {
  signature,
  commentData,
};
```

üßë‚Äçüíª _[/apps/demo/src/app/api/sign-comment/route.ts#L83-L103](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/3cd058f61c0fb1fbe945167abbe61f33a472b9ff/apps/demo/src/app/api/sign-comment/route.ts#L83-L103)_

:::warning
Do not expose the app signer's private key on the client side.

In the demo, we store the private key in the environment variable `APP_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY`.
Next.JS ensures that the environment variable without `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is only available on the server side.
:::

Now that we have finished server-side signing, let's move on to the client side.

#### The Author signs and sends the transaction

In the demo, we use a combination of `wagmi` and `rainbowkit` to connect the user wallet and send the transaction to the contract.
You can find out how it was set up in the `providers` component:

```tsx
<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
  <WagmiProvider config={config}>
    <RainbowKitProvider>{children}</RainbowKitProvider>
  </WagmiProvider>
</QueryClientProvider>
```

Now with the wagmi ready to go, and the comment data and app signature returned from the server, we can now post the comment to the contract:

```typescript
await writeContractAsync({
  abi: CommentsV1Abi,
  address: COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS,
  functionName: "postCommentAsAuthor",
  args: [commentData, appSignature],
});
```

##### Congratulations! You've completed the tutorial!

### Post the comment in batch with other transactions

:::danger
**This guide doesn't work at the moment because it uses experimental features.**

:::warning
**This guide doesn't work with Anvil because it uses token swaps. Please use Base chain for testing.**
:::

In this section, we will walkthrough the code from the [demo app](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/apps/demo) to illustrate the process of posting a comment as the author in batch with other transactions to save on gas fees.

The ECP supports 4 types of comment posting flows, each with its pros and cons.

Here we will discuss [the batch posting flow](/post-comment-flows#4-posting-comment-in-batch-with-other-transactions-author-pays-gas):

- App server authorizes the post by signing the comment data.
- Author creates calldata for posting the comment and other transactions and sends them in a single batched transaction.

You may want to read more about the [post comment flows](/post-comment-flows) for more details.

#### The Contract

- For latest contract address, see [COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS](/sdk-reference/defaultExports/variables/COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS).
- We will call [`postCommentAsAuthor()`](/protocol-reference/CommentsV1#postcommentasauthorstruct-commentsv1commentdata-commentdata-bytes-appsignature-external) method to post the comment.

#### Demo Dependencies

Here is a quick rundown of some of the dependencies used in the demo app:

#### The Author signs and sends the transaction

In the demo, we use a combination of `wagmi` and `rainbowkit` to connect the user wallet and send the transaction to the contract.
You can find out how it was set up in the `providers` component:

```tsx
<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
  <WagmiProvider config={config}>
    <RainbowKitProvider>{children}</RainbowKitProvider>
  </WagmiProvider>

```

üßë‚Äçüíª _[/apps/demo/src/app/providers.tsx#L16-L20](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/094bcde2bca079bd7451c6571f26c5687b2ad128/apps/demo/src/app/providers.tsx#L16-L20)_

Now with the wagmi ready to go, and the comment data and app signature returned from the server, we can now post the comment to the contract as part of batched transaction using [EIP 7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702):

##### 1. Extend the wallet client with EIP 7702 actions

This operation requires viem's wallet client to be extended with [EIP 7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) actions, see [viem's docs](https://viem.sh/experimental/eip7702/client) for more details.

```typescript
const eip7702wallet = walletClient.extend(eip7702Actions());
```

##### 2. Sign the authorization for the batch delegation contract

This will turn your account into smart contract by merging the batch delegation contract and your account for the transaction.

```typescript
const authorization = await eip7702wallet.signAuthorization({
  contractAddress: publicEnv.NEXT_PUBLIC_BATCH_CALL_DELEGATION_PROTOCOL_ADDRESS,
});
```

üßë‚Äçüíª _[/apps/demo/src/lib/contract.ts#L82-L85](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/ca0425c97dab3bca42ecaa6b050679eafb3ef98d/apps/demo/src/lib/contract.ts#L82-L85)_

##### 3. Construct the calldata and post the comment

You already have signed comment from the server, now you need to construct the calldata for the comment posting. This calldata will then be delegated by the batch delegation contract.

```typescript
sendBatchedTransaction({
  args: [
    // This is the comment posting calldata.
    // It is essentially the same thing as calling
    // writeContract directly from Post comment as author tutorial.
    {
      to: COMMENTS_V1_ADDRESS,
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: CommentsV1Abi,
        functionName: "postCommentAsAuthor",
        args: [signedComment.data, signedComment.signature],
      }),
      value: 0n,
    },
    ...moreCalldatas, // you can batch more operations here
  ],
  walletClient,
});
```

üßë‚Äçüíª _[/apps/demo/src/lib/contract.ts#L50-L58](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/blob/ca0425c97dab3bca42ecaa6b050679eafb3ef98d/apps/demo/src/lib/contract.ts#L50-L58)_

### Best Practices

1. Implement proper error handling
1. Monitor gas costs and adjust gas limits accordingly
1. Consider implementing retry mechanisms for failed transactions
1. Keep private keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
1. While the contract doesn't impose rate limits, consider implementing application-level rate limiting to prevent spam and manage gas costs effectively.
1. Consider anti-spam measures

### Additional Resources

- Check out **gasless** [post comment flows](/post-comment-flows)
- See [Protocol API Reference](/protocol-reference/CommentsV1) for more functions and details.
- See [Demo App Source Code](https://github.com/ecp-eth/comments-monorepo/tree/main/apps/demo) for implementations of:
  1. The other post comment flows.
  2. Request permission from the user for gasless posting.
  3. Deleting comments.
