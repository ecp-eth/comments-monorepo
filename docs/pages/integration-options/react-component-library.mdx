# Integration Options

## React Component Library

The React component library provides pre-built, customizable UI components for seamless integration into your React applications.
This is the recommended approach for most web applications.

```tsx
import { CommentsEmbed } from "@ecp.eth/sdk/embed";

const baseOrigin = "https://blog.example.com";

export function Comments() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <CommentsEmbed
        // the uri for commenting
        uri={new URL(window.location.pathname, baseOrigin)}
        // the config object allows you to customize the CommentsEmbed's appearance
        theme={{
          {
            // mode controls which theme to use, it can be 'light' or 'dark'
            mode: "light",
            colors: {
              dark: {
                background: "black",
                foreground: "#e9e9ea",
              },
              light: {
                background: "white",
                foreground: "#4c4c4c",
              },
            },
          },
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Please note that if you are rendering the `CommentsEmbed` with server-side rendering (SSR), you do not have access to the `window` object.
  Instead, you may want to construct the `uri` out of the `HttpRequest` object of your server-side framework.
- Please also read the `targetUri` carefully in [Comment Data](/comment-data-props) for choosing an appropriate `uri`.
