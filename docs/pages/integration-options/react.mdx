```tsx
import { CommentsEmbed } from '@ecp.eth/sdk/react'

const baseOrigin = 'https://blog.example.com'

export function Comments() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <CommentsEmbed
        // the uri for commenting
        uri={new URL(
          window.location.pathname,
          baseOrigin
        ).toString()}
      />
    </div>`
  )
}
```

Be careful when choosing the value for the `uri` property. The `uri` serves as a unique identifier to locate comments:

1. If your web page is dynamic and accepts query parameters, you should carefully consider which parameters are necessary to locate the correct comments
   and include them in the `uri` property. As a general rule, include query parameters that affect the page content.
2. If you are rendering the `CommentsEmbed` with server-side rendering (SSR), you do not have access to the `window` object.

The `uri` must be a unique string that follows the [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) standard.
