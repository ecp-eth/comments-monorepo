# Comment Data

`Comment Data` is a data structure that contains the essential information of a comment.

## `content`

The comment content stores plain text content of the comment.

- Please use `\n` for line breaks. (Most browsers will normalize the line breaks to `\n` regardless of the OS).

## `metadata`

The `metadata` property is used to store additional information in JSON format about the comment.

- Must be a valid JSON string (RFC 8259)[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259].
- Please be mindful that storing large amount of data on chain will increase the cost of the transaction.

## `targetUri`

It serves as a unique identifier to locate comments.

Be careful when choosing the value for the `targetUri` property as inconsistent `targetUri` will result in some comments missing from the indexer response.

- It must be a unique string that follows the [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) standard.
- If your web page is dynamic and accepts query parameters, you should carefully consider which parameters are necessary to locate the correct comments. As a general rule:

  1.  Include query parameters that affect the page content into the `targetUri`.
  1.  Arrange them in consistent order.

## `parentId`

The `parentId` property is used to store the parent comment id.

- If the comment is a reply to a comment, set the `parentId` to the id of the parent comment.
- If the comment is a top level comment, leave it `undefined`.

## `author`

The `author` property is used to store the author's address. It is the address of the account that created and owns the comment.

## `appSigner`

The `appSigner` property is used to store the app signer's address.

## `salt`

The `salt` property is a randomly generated 32 bytes data.

- It is used as part of the hashing process to generate a unique comment id.

## `deadline`

The deadline is a timestamp in seconds since epoch. Posting a comment with expired deadline will result in the transaction being reverted.

- Must be a future timestamp.
- It is used to prevent replay attacks, so ensure it is not be set to a value too large.
